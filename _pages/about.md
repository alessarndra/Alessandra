# About me

Curious about how organisms adapt to fluctuating environments, I’m pivoting from plant photoprotection to the **microbial ecology of soils**. I enjoy building clean analyses and clear stories — from wet lab to code to communication.

## Path to the PhD
I’m an incoming PhD student in the **Department of Pathology (Enright Group), University of Cambridge**, focusing on the soil microbiome using **Oxford Nanopore** long-read sequencing.  
Previously, I studied **Natural Sciences (Plant Sciences)** at Cambridge, taking modules across microbiology, ecology, zoology and plant biology.

My final-year research project in the **Kromdijk Group** explored *photoprotective mechanisms* — particularly the **PsbS** protein and NPQ dynamics — in early-diverging chlorophyte species.

## Beyond the lab
I’m collaborating with **Kiseki**, a start-up using AI to design novel proteins for flavour. I also care about teaching and widening participation, mentoring school students via **STEM Smart** and supporting applicants during Cambridge open days and interviews.
