## Hi — I’m Alessandra

I’m an incoming PhD student in the [Department of Pathology](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/) at the **University of Cambridge**, in the [Enright group](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/research/cellular-and-molecular-pathology-division/enright-group). I previously studied **Natural Sciences** also at Cambridge and specialised in Plant Sciences, taking modules spanning microbiology, ecology, zoology and plant sciences. I completed a final year research project in the [Department of Plant Sciences](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/) with the [Kromdijk group](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/environmental-plant-physiology), exploring photoprotective mechanisms and the PsbS protein in early diverging chlorophyte species. 

My PhD research will focus on exploring the soil microbiome, using oxford nanopore sequencing technology. 

Outside of the lab, I am currently working with a start-up, Kiseki, that aims to use AI to develop novel proteins that revolutionise flavour.
