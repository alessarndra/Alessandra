  <p>This page highlights four substantive research experiences. I’ve chosen concision and clarity over attaching full reports (undergraduate coursework was strong, but not polished for publication). If you’d like more detail on any project, I’m happy to discuss—just drop me a note via <a href="/contact/">Contact</a>.</p>

## Photoprotective Proteins in Plants – Final-Year Project (Cambridge)

**Affiliation:** Kromdijk Group, Dept. of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge  
**Focus:** Functional diversity of early-diverging **PsbS proteins** and their role in NPQ dynamics under fluctuating light  
**Approach:** Chlorophyll fluorescence assays, qPCR gene profiling, protein sequence modelling, R/Python data analysis  
**Insights:** Discovered variation in photoprotective capacities that could inform crop resilience strategies.

## Critical Review: “Ecosystem Health” Concepts

**Scope:** Synthesised varied frameworks (biodiversity metrics, resilience, ecosystem service value) to examine how “ecosystem health” is conceptualised in conservation.  
**Conclusion:** Such a term is multi-dimensional and context-dependent, not adequately captured by single metrics. Highlights importance of definition in policy-driven ecology.

**Context:** Sabah’s ancient lowland dipterocarp forest, managed by Yayasan Sabah / SEARRP as a premier biodiversity research station ([malaysiamap.org](https://www.malaysiamap.org/map-search-detail2b5e.html?mapID=ee376b1d7e07ad59efd0392179da006d&utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
**Focus:** Abundance and ecological implications of aerial fungal networks (Masiminius spp.) in logged vs. pristine rainforest  
**Techniques:** Canopy surveys, photosynthetic measures, ImageJ image analysis, R statistics  
**Take-home message:** Fungal networks are more prevalent in disturbed forest and support arthropod microhabitats despite negligible impact on photosynthesis.

## Behavioural Ecology of Damaraland Mole-Rats (Kalahari, South Africa)

**Supervisor:** Prof. Tim Clutton-Brock (Large Mammal Research Group, University of Cambridge) at Kuruman River Reserve  
**Focus:** Social structure, activity patterns, and cooperative behaviour in subterranean Damaraland mole-rats  
**Methods:** Field observation, focal sampling, R data analysis  
**Key insights:** Flexible division of labour supports efficient colony functioning; high engagement with long-term behavioural datasets.
